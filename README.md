# Amazon Product Data Analysis Project

Description

This project performs an in-depth analysis of Amazon product data. The objective is to draw insights regarding product ratings, sales, categories, and pricing. Through this analysis, we aim to understand consumer behavior, popular product categories, and the relationship between product price and customer satisfaction.

The dataset used in this project contains information on various Amazon products including their prices, ratings, categories, and number of sales.

Key Findings

The most sold and popular items on Amazon are Smart Watches and USB Cables.
The highest-rated products were mostly electronic devices and accessories.
The most expensive products are mostly electronics, especially Smart TVs and High-End Smartphones.
The category with the most products listed is USB Cables, followed by Smart Watches and Smartphones.
The highest revenue generating categories are Televisions and Smartphones.
A mild correlation was found between price and ratings, indicating that high price doesn't necessarily mean high customer satisfaction.
The categories with the highest average prices were air conditioners and laptops.
